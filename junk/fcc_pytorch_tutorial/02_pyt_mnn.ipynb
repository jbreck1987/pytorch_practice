    "### Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "Now that we've explored a binary classification problem with linear and non-linear architectures, we now want to shift to a multi-class problem where there are more than two options that the model needs to be able to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-class data will be artificial data from the scikit-learn `make_blobs()` function. The general flow is as follows:\n",
    "1. Make the artificial data and convert to tensors\n",

    "3. Define the model architecture\n",
    "4. Train the model\n",

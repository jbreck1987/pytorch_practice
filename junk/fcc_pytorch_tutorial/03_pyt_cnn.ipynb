    "CNNs are great for problems that require classification (and sometimes regression) from visual data. CNNs are useful because *they* find the features themselves as opposed to us determining the features to use. We just give the CNN a label and data that is somewhat visual and let it go.\n",
    "The general flow for this notebook will be:\n",
    "1. Explore tools from PyTorch that allow for the import/transformation of different types of visual data\n",
    "2. Importing data image data from a clothing database\n",
    "3. Design a Multi-Class NN model that will be used to classify the different types of clothing in the images\n",
    "4. Examine the results and then create a CNN model and compare the performance to the MCNN\n",
    "5. Save the weights from model with the best results so that it can be used elsewhere"
